`neowrapped.nvim`

A completely useless plugin that wraps up your **entire Neovim** experience into meaningless stats. It tracksnothing important, offers no actual insights, and will never improve your workflowâ€”**but it looks really cool**.

Features:

- Check your _most useless_ commands of the year
- Feel nostalgic about all those wasted keystrokes
- Impress your friends with utterly meaningless data visualizations
- Perfect for absolutely no one, but who cares?

**Because, who needs productivity metrics when you can have _pretty stats_?**
